# Union-Find

This is very easy union find implementation. I code in java.


## Requirement

- JDK
- Visual Studio Code

### Step 1 - Installing JDK

You need to install [**JDK**](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) dowload and install it.

#### Check for your JDK install or not

Try to run these commands in terminal or cmd.

```bash
java --version
```

```bash
javac
```

```bash
java
```

If you getting the error so you did not set the environment variables
and this problem only faces in `windows users`.

### Step 2 - Installing Visual Studio Code

Then we install [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
just because it was a lightweight text editor and you install many plugins.

> And you are good to go!
